        <h1>A few <span>words</span> about me</h1>
        <p>
          I come from Lower Silesia, where I also completed my IT technical school.
          Since a computer appeared in my home, I started creating my works in
          Paint. <br /><br />I built my first applications in Scratch, but I have
          always been drawn to graphics. My passion for cartoons and computer games
          inspired me to create my own comic series, which I continue to develop to this day.
          I constantly have new ideas for various plots and stories.

          In middle school, I managed to buy my first computer. My first graphic works
          were created using the "sketchbook-scanner-mouse" method (which involved
          creating a drawing on paper, scanning it with a scanner, and tracing it
          with a mouse). It wasn't until technical school, where I also learned web
          technologies, that I invested in a graphics tablet. Both devices serve me to
          this day. <br /><br />I wanted to further develop my skills,
          so I looked for a job that would allow me to pursue my passion. Thanks
          to my cousin's recommendation, I became interested in the Symfony framework.
          Appropriate courses helped me discover a modern approach to coding
          websites, which significantly exceeded the patterns known from school.

          However, I ended up working in an advertising agency and retail sales.
          Here I discovered how to handle commercial graphics from behind the scenes.
          However, I knew it would be difficult for me to find a job in the IT industry
          in my area. Therefore, my heart and mind led me to Kalisz. I also decided
          to study computer science part-time in Wroc≈Çaw.<br /><br />
          I found a job as IT Support, which also allowed me to refine my IT knowledge.
          In the meantime, I prepared my portfolio and took on smaller graphic assignments.
          I also participated in online forums, where I helped others with their computer
          or programming problems.

          Currently, I have no intention of stopping - there is still much to learn and
          many dreams to fulfill ahead of me.

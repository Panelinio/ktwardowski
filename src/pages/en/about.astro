        <h1>A few <span>words</span> about me</h1>
        <p>
          I come from Lower Silesia, where I also completed my technical high
          school in IT. Since a computer appeared in my home, I started creating
          my works in Paint. <br /><br />I built my first applications in
          Scratch, but I have always been drawn to graphics. My passion for
          cartoons and computer games inspired me to create my own comic series,
          which I continue to develop to this day. I constantly have new ideas
          for various plots and stories.

          In middle school, I managed to buy my first computer. My first graphic
          works were created using the "sketchbook-scanner-mouse" method (this
          involved creating a drawing on paper, scanning it with a scanner, and
          tracing it using a mouse). It was only in technical high school, where
          I also learned web technologies, that I invested in a graphics tablet.
          Both devices serve me to this day. <br /><br />I wanted to further
          develop my skills, so I looked for a job that would allow me to pursue
          my passion. Thanks to a cousin's recommendation, I became interested
          in the Symfony framework. Appropriate courses helped me discover a
          modern approach to coding websites, which significantly exceeded the
          patterns known from school.

          However, I ended up working in an advertising agency and retail sales.
          Here I discovered how to handle commercial graphics from the inside.
          However, I knew that it would be difficult for me to find a job in the
          IT industry in my area. Therefore, my heart and mind led me to Kalisz.
          I also decided to study IT part-time in Wroc≈Çaw.<br /><br />
          I found a job as IT Support, which also allowed me to polish my IT knowledge.
          In the meantime, I was preparing my portfolio and accepting smaller graphic
          assignments. I also participated in online forums, where I helped others
          with their computer or programming problems.

          Currently, I have no intention of stopping - there is still much to
          learn and many dreams to fulfill ahead of me.
